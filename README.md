# <#Build Your Ride>

## Description

The motivation for this project, was to create a user friendly application that allows users to either create a new car, or select a pre-existing saved vehicle, and preform various different actions on the vehicle. While the user is performing the actions on the car, the application will accurately display responses, depending on the users vehical capabilities. This application allows trucks to easily verify if they are able to tow another vehicle, and will successfully tow a vehicle if permissible. Throughout the making of this application, I was able to better understand how the use of classes can be used to define properties and methods that can be reused throughout my application, promoting code reusability and maintainability.

Instructions on how to use application:

First the user must run npm start in their terminal to trigger the first prompt, to choose between creating a new vehicle, or selecting from an existing vehicle.

If the user selects that they would like to create a new vehicle, it will then ask if they would like to create a car, truck or motorbike. Each vehicle type will prompt different questions, as not all vehicles have the same abilities.

If the user selects "select an existing vehicle", it will display all vehicles that are currently saved in the program.

Once the user has either selected an existing vehicle, or created their new vehicle, they will have the ability to preform actions on the vehicle. Once the user selects the action they want to perform on their vehicle, the application will display a message showing the action was succesfully performed, or an error message will populate.
